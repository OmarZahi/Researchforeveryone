        <h2>Mission</h2>
        <p>Research for Everyone exists to make hands‑on science accessible. We provide a clear pathway for students and early‑career researchers to get real laboratory experience through standardized safety training and supervised sessions at partner labs.</p>
        <h2>Approach</h2>
        <p>We align with each host lab’s SOPs, enforce strict supervision ratios and access controls, and keep all activities within BSL‑1 and basic digital fabrication tools.</p>
